# Contributing
If you are here, you probably want to contribute code or documentation (or something else) to PolyJS! Thank you!

To get started, fork the repository and make your changes. Be sure to test them before committing! 

Create a pull request into my master branch. To make it easy on us, check the 'allow edits by maintainers' checkbox. It lets us add commits directly to the PR to fix bugs or other things. I will review your changes before merging them. If I notice something that seems off, I may suggest changes that need to be addressed, etc.

Be sure to follow the pull request and issue templates (if applicable, you may need to add/remove headings). They help me quickly review your suggestions, but I won't reject your pull request or issue simply because it doesn't follow the template!
